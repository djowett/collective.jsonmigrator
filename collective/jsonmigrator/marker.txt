Set Marker Interfaces on an object
====================================

Sometimes it is necessary to set a marker interface based on a condition.
I encountered this whilst importing Products.Carousel folders.
The pipeline below demonstrates what was done for that usecase, but it can be
used in others too.

    [transmogrifier]
    pipeline =
        source
        constructor
        carousel-marker

    [constructor]
    blueprint = collective.transmogrifier.sections.constructor

    [carousel-marker]
    blueprint = collective.jsonmigrator.marker
    interface = Products.Carousel.interfaces.ICarouselFolder
    condition = python:item['_type']=='Folder' and item['_path'].endswith('carousel')
